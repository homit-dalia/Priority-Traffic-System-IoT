# Priority-Traffic-System-IoT
Priority Traffic System is a mini-project under Internet of Things, where pedestrian crossing and emergency services are prioritized over general traffic.

### Materials Required
This project was made using Arduino UNO, but can also be made with Node MCU, Raspberry Pi, etc. I have used Red and Green lights to depict Traffic Signals for reducing unnecessary complexity but you can use Yellow lights as well. These are the materials required:
- Arduino UNO
- 4 Buttons/Switch
- 4 10k Ohm Resistor
- 4 Red LED Lights
- 4 Green LED Lights
- 12 100 Ohm Resistor 
- Breadboard
- Sound Sensor
- Jumpoer Cables (Connecting Wires)
